I have been kicked several times for no actual reason, and some people just click yes on the voting GUI because it covers a little bit of your screen and you don't care. My suggestion is that when someone votekicks someone with the command, there will instead be a little dropdown menu on the top of your screen (between the chat and your stats)  that appears for 8 seconds on other players screens (or however long you think it should be) and you can click on a little arrow to check who will be votekicked. I also think that it would make more sense to have like /votekick (players reasoning for votekicking someone). If the reasoning is too long then I would make it into like you can scroll to see the rest of the reasoning for votekicking someone."

Different Punishments: Basically instead of a server ban, I want it to go from kick, to 1hr ban, 2hr, 4hr, and basically the ban serveness keeps increasing per every kick you had amassed in either this or every (alive) server. \n2. Better gui: Basically I mean a GUI where you can pull up a votekick, select player, type in reason, etc. It's kinda basic, But I like this idea\n3. Kick Reasons: self exploratory.\n4. Votekick Pity: It may be a bad idea BUT if you try to get kicked from the same person again and again, the person will be unable to kick for a good minute. (The message for a tempted kick while pity is on \"(Kicker) tried to kick (Person) too many times and is thus unable to votekick for (Time).\"\n\nGame Suggestions:\n1. Part Claiming: Basically, Just a ez way to prevent grieving or make people trapped in a inescapable box\n2. Spawn part packs: self explainable. Choice to spawn via coins or robux.\n\nsorry it's long\nEdit: no I don't expect these to be added"

The base cost is 2000, level 2, 3000, and level 3, 4500. This perk does NOT work if someone is standing on it or is sitting on it.\n\nAt level 1, it can hold up to 3-5 blocks depending of their size. At level 2, it can hold up to 4-8 blocks, and level 3 can hold up to 6-10 blocks.\n\nYou CAN NOT just hold the blocks like it was just a single block, depending of the size and amount of the blocks, it will be less and less controllable, reaching the max amount of blocks would make the items almost drag (so you cant just fling everything).\n\nFor balance reason, you could also make so your speed when holding more than 1 block is decreased by 10% to 20% depending of the amount of blocks"

May be a little hard to code, but I think it’ll be better if thats a feature so mobile players can actually play the game :d"

And the 2nd pakour part is merged with the rising lava ball thingy part, so basically there's no part for you to stay on, you have to do the pakour to get to the end before the lava catches up to you while there's a meteor rain going on. \nDesign Changes: All the grass will be recolored to red instead of green, same with the tree in the end of the map"

What I think should be done is to have a random chance of having rounds get rain. For instance, when a round is selected to have rain there should be a warning/message pop up (where the map names + game modifiers appear) telling the players that the rounds going to have rain start pouring, which it will after the flood starts rising or has risen to a certain point. The rain's function will be to damage the player but not kill it as that would be a bit too much (so its going to keep the health at a lower number like 10). This mid-round event will bring rain back as an occasional difficulty spike in the game (since you do need to make a ceiling on your boat), which I feel like is going to make a lot of players happy and have a lot more fun!"

This leads to an issue where the only people who use Tank are those who can’t afford Large Stomach.\n\nI propose that you give the Tank 2% Regeneration/Second after not taking damage for 5 Seconds. This buff will give the Tank an advantage against Large Stomach users in long-term sustainability, as it now only takes around 50 seconds to go from 0% to 100% Health instead of 200, while Large Stomach users will have to consume food to match Tank’s recovery time.\n\nIt sounds like a massive buff, (and it is) but Tank deserves it. It has so many downsides compared to Gatherer (downsides negated by Snack and Air Tanks) or Large Stomach (forced to use Snack Pack) that it absolutely needs something major to put it on-par with the others.\n\nThis change also wouldn’t be too overpowered; it’s still at a disadvantage against Large Stomach since Tank’s recovery would take 5 uninterrupted seconds to kick in, and Large Stomach users have only 25 less health than Tanks after eating their food along with not having a damage or maneuverability reduction."

         "content": "suggestion: a gamepass (or maybe a perk or something) that makes it so you can view the stats of an item. EX: Buoyancy, Max HP, Current HP, etc. For a gamepass, i feel like a fair price would be 50 robux since the gamepasses for this game are fairly cheap. For a purchasable item, I feel like 10,000 coins would be suitable (due to how strong it is). Either this could be an addition to a perk, like engineer, or it could be a new perk all together, the more you level it up the stronger it is and the more stats it shows. It should also list specific buffs for future and current items and things that effect it. EX: Holding click on a piece of plastic would show somewhere in the text \"+15% HP (LVL 3 Engineer)\" or something. \n\nJust an idea I thought of, not entirely sure if it would fit in the game or not."
